 INTRODUCTION: 
 Zomato API Analysis is one of the most useful analysis for foodies who want to taste the best cuisines of every part of the world which lies in their budget. This analysis is also for those who want to find the value for money restaurants in various parts of the country for the cuisines. Additionally, this analysis caters the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the country and which locality of that country serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants.

In Data Analysis of Zomato Dataset, I did the following things:
1.Missing Values were seen using 
isnull().sum() and [features for features in df.columns if df[features].isnull().sum()>0].
Explored heatmap for visualizing the missing values.
Country_code file and zomato file both were merged into a single dataframe.
2.Explored about the Numerical Variables  
3.Explored about categorical Variables  
4.Finding Relationship between features
